    <h2>Introduction to JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a language that helps make websites interactive. It allows you to add things like buttons, animations, or forms that users can interact with. While HTML gives structure to a webpage and CSS adds style, JavaScript adds actions, so things can move, respond, or change based on what the user does.</p>

    <h2>Why is JavaScript important in web development?</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is very important because it allows websites to be more than just simple, static pages. It makes websites more fun and useful by allowing things like pop-up messages, auto-filled forms, and content that updates without needing to refresh the whole page. This makes using websites smoother and more enjoyable for users.</p>

    <h2>How does JavaScript differ from other programming languages?</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is different from languages like Python or Java because it runs inside your web browser. You donâ€™t need any special software to use it, just the browser. While Python or Java are often used to do work behind the scenes (on the server), JavaScript was made to work with the part of the website users see. Now, with Node.js, JavaScript can also work on the backend (server-side), making it very versatile.</p>
